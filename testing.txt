"I don't know what fire is like streak from snapchat"
*******************Thinks zzz is snoozing
OO add new item, yay! Did it add it? Oh it did
Adding worked
***BUGGGGGGGG when click on menu thing on bottom it doesn't work
"I dont know why it's is that bad.."
Sort by priority: Oh, fire is the highest priority she says, now understands what priority icons mean
"I couldn't tell if sort by priority was on or not until I looked at the icons"
*******- Says should have more of an indication that it is on
(can't tell if the gray or white means sorted or not sorted)

Figured out the delete completed part
Was able to chagne priorities on list item
******Says would be good to have more indication for completed items -- then says thinks it's okay after awhile.
"Can you drag?"
Menu item thing goes under the "Add new item" bar
Says " oh nice" when it auto sorts by priority after changing priority of an item
Wonders if it would sort based on which one you set as the emoji first. Then realizes it doesn't, "Interesting", then realizes sorted based on "first one that went in"

"so it always comes in as a snooze?" Do you like that? Only other option would be you choose it before you enter it within the list, but that would be same amount of actions so it's okay.

"It's something I would use"

Other things you want:
********- Dragging ability.

Other ideas:
- When add new item, scroll down automatically
