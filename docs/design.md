# Element Placement

We decided to place the "Add Task (+)" button on the bottom left hand corner of the screen because most people are right-handed. When holding a phone with just the right hand, the bottom-left corner is the most accesible with the right thumb. This should reduce the friction in using our to-do app.

New items go at the bottom of the list because this is what happens when people add items to a physical (on paper) to do list so we believe this is more intuitive.

Checkbox goes on the left of each task for the same reason. We included a checkbox because otherwise, it may not be immediately obvious how to mark an item as complete/incomplete.

To edit a task, the user can click on the hamburger icon, where they will also be able to edit other details of the task. This icon is a common icon used to edit details.

Deleting all tasks that are completed is a hard task to show in a single icon. It is also a destructive operation, so it would be bad if the user accidentally clicked this icon without knowing what it does. Thus, we place this task under the hamburger icon in the upper right corner along with a text description. Additionally, it is not a common action, so it is okay for it to take more clicks to activate.


# Task Element

Clicking on the task (everywhere except the little hamburger) should mark the item as completed/not-completed because this is probably the most common action most users would want to do to this item.

We decided to have different emojis (üî•, ‚ö†Ô∏è, üí§) for the different priority levels for people who are color blind. This was a suggestion from Prof. Rhodes.
