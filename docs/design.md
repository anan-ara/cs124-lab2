# Element Placement

On the top bar, we added toggle buttons that change how the tasks in the list are displayed. We have a toggle button for Sort by Priority, and a toggle button for Show/Hide Completed Tasks. We thought that these actions are actions a user may use often, so it is not hidden in a menu.

Deleting all tasks that are completed is a destructive action, so it would be bad if the user accidentally clicked this icon without knowing what it does. Thus, we placed this action under the menu icon in the upper right corner along with a text description. Additionally, it is not a common action, so it is okay for it to take more clicks to activate.

New items go at the bottom of the list because this is what happens when people add items to a physical (on paper) to-do list so we believe this is more intuitive.

We decided to place the "Add Task (+)" button on the bottom left hand corner of the screen because most people are right-handed. When holding a phone with just the right hand, the bottom-left corner is the most accesible with the right thumb. This should reduce the friction in using our to-do app. Additionally, this is an element that is likely to be used multiple times in quick succession, and it would be annoying for the user if it were to move with each usage, so it is pinned to the bottom of the app. This was a suggestion by Prof. Rhodes.

To edit a task, the user can click on the menu icon, where they will also be able to edit other details of the task. This icon is a common icon used to edit details.

# Task Element

Clicking on the task (everywhere except the menu) should mark the item as completed/not-completed because this is probably the most common action most users would want to do to this item.

The checkbox goes on the left of each task as that is where it is usually positioned on a physical to-do list. We included a checkbox because otherwise, it may not be immediately obvious how to mark an item as complete/incomplete. After checking an item, we grey out the text for that task. We considered putting a strikethrough on the text for completed tasks but we ended up deciding not to for readability.

We decided to have different emojis (üî•, ‚ö†Ô∏è, üí§) for the different priority levels for people who are color blind. This was a suggestion from Prof. Rhodes. 

We made the üí§ the default priority level for tasks as if a user does not bother to change the priority level of a task, it is usually a safe assumption that it is unimportant.



# Color Palette

We chose a very neutral grey color palette as our app will have a lot of color from the priority levels we can assign to each task and we do not want it to clash with the background and overall theme of the app.

#ffffff, #e6e6e6, #999999, #494949
