    <H1>Mark an item as complete.</H1>

    <h2>The existing list with the incomplete item</h2>

        <iframe src="state1.html" height="640" width="360" style="border:1px solid black;"></iframe>
        <p>
        This shows the existing list with the existing item "Call Mom". 
        <br/>
        Note that the checkbox is currently white, signifying that it is unchecked and the task has yet to be completed.

    <H2>After marking the item as complete.</H2>

    <div>

        <p>
            Final result after marking the item as complete. The checkbox turns grey because this is the most asthetically pleasing. 
            (As opposed to having a bright blue checkbox, which would not fit with our color scheme.)
            The text also turns a lighter shade of grey to make other existing tasks that are not yet completed pop out more.
