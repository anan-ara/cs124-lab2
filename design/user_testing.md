User Testing Keo and Cole:
- First asks “what is this”
- First sees input text field for adding an item, 
- Sees change priority emoji
- Is confused at first about top few icons
- Says can put emoji on it, 
- Then sees the delete
- Cole sees that it’s a task list
- It’s like a hw app!
- Then they see it’s priority, sort by priority
- “Oh I can’t move shit that’s sad”
- “Usually the three lines means I can move it”
- Doesn’t like the stop sign
- A feature to add: Reoccurring ones to reset every week.
- Have a way to sort by class, color label, etc. 
TODOS:- dragging and dropping


Sydney:
- Gets the priority icons, understands right away what each of them mean
- Its a task list
- Then 

Kaveh:
- Let’s see if I can figure out the UI
- Likes the show and hide completed buttons
- The checked checkbox could be made more explicit. Right now it is ambiguous as to what is checked, but then says it is grayed out and pretty obvious
- Likes icons

Zooey + Amy
- First tries to click stuff in top bar but can’t do anything with it yet
- When adds stuff into the list , she realizes its a todo list
- Thinks its cool that it hides the thing when it is done
- Thinks that the button we didn’t impleement is to change priority of individual todos first, then realizes how to actually change it. 
- Start with some simple items in there as default so people know its a list
- Copy what exists. 
- Say it should be the three dots not the three lines
- Amy says priority icons could be more explicit, traffic sign, also the emojis itself 
- Swipe to delete would be good.
